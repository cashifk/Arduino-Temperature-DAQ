# Arduino-Temperature-DAQ
This is a temperature DAQ with multiple sensors (Dallas ds18b20) working on Arduino &amp; gets it data processed in Python.Cancel Changes
connect the fused sensors on pin2 and a 4.7k pull up between postive (5v) & signal pin (pin2) on arduino. 

Change the com port on the python code as used in the Arduino.


Will work on version 2 to improve dynamic detection of com port and executable python file to directly run the test upon connection.
